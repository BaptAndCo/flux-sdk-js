# Instructions for publishing the JS SDK to NPM.
#
# 1. Run all the tests!!!!!
# 2. Update all references to the version, e.g.: `git grep <old_version>`
# 3. Update CHANGELOG.md to include the new changes
# 4. Run this script with the publish argument: `./publish.sh publish`.
# 5. Add a commit to bump the version.
# 6. Tag the commit with `v<version #>`.
# 7. Push the commit and tag:
#      `git push upstream master && git push upstream master â€”-tags`
#   (assuming fluxio/flux-sdk-js is set as the `upstream` remote).
#
# NOTE: If `npm install` fails, try running `npm link flux-sdk-common`
# *first* and then retrying `npm install`
