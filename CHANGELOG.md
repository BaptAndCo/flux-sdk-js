# Change Log

This document tracks noteworthy changes to the Flux JavaScript SDK.

The JavaScript SDK follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).
While the API is considered unstable until we reach `1.0.0`, we will attempt
to increment the minor version (`Y` in `x.Y.z`) if and when there are
breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 5/5/2016

This marks the first open source release!

If you are coming from an earlier beta version, please check out our
[migration guide](https://flux.gitbooks.io/flux-javascript-sdk/content/docs/Migration.html).
Please [let us know](mailto:sdk@flux.io) if you have additional questions or feedback.
